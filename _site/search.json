    "text": "IntroductionüìÑ:\nEducation plays a foundational role in advancing societal development, shaping economic prosperity, and improving quality of life across generations. This report utilizes comprehensive data from UNESCO to examine global disparities in educational access, with a specific focus on the out-of-school rates among primary school-aged children.\nThe datasets leveraged in this analysis include unicef_indicator.csv, which provides detailed information on educational participation rates segmented by gender and country, and unicef_metadata.csv, offering broader socioeconomic indicators such as GDP per capita, inflation rates, and life expectancy at birth. Together, these datasets enable a holistic exploration of the connections between educational exclusion and economic conditions across nations.\nThis report aims to underscore the urgent need for inclusive educational policies and targeted interventions to promote equitable learning opportunities and sustainable development worldwide.\n##Understanding Global Education and Economic Disparitiesüì£: Measured through the percentage of primary school-aged children who are out of school, this indicator offers critical insights into the accessibility of education and the socioeconomic challenges faced by different nations.\nFrom educational participation rates to broader economic and health indicators, this report provides a comprehensive analysis of the forces shaping human development across countries. It highlights essential metrics such as the out-of-school rate among primary school children, GDP per capita, average life expectancy, and inflation rate. These indicators offer valuable perspectives on the well-being, resilience, and future prospects of global populations, informing policymakers and development leaders in their pursuit of equitable growth and sustainable societal progress.\n##Top 10 Countries with Highest Out-of-School Rates Among Primary School Childrenüö©: This visualization highlights the countries where the challenges to universal primary education are most acute, based on the percentage of primary school-aged children who are not attending school.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Load the dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv('/content/unicef_indicator.csv')  # Adjust path if needed\n\n# Filter for the correct indicator and year\nindicator_name = 'Out-of-school rate for children of primary school age (administrative data)'\ndf_filtered = df[\n    (df['indicator'] == indicator_name) &\n    (df['sex'] == 'Total') &\n    (df['year'] == 2020)\n]\n\n# Sort by Percentage and select top 10\ndf_top10 = df_filtered.sort_values(by='Percentage', ascending=False).head(10)\n\n# Create bar chart\nfig = px.bar(\n    df_top10,\n    x='country',\n    y='Percentage',\n    title='Top 10 Countries with Highest Out-of-School Rates Among Primary School Children (2020)',\n    labels={'country': 'Country', 'Percentage': 'Out-of-School Rate (%)'}\n)\n\nfig.update_layout(xaxis_tickangle=-45)\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\nRegional Insights: The countries displayed are predominantly from Africa, reflecting persistent educational disparities across the continent. A few nations from other regions may appear as exceptions but overall, the map draws attention to critical educational challenges concentrated within specific geographic areas.\nSeverity and Variations: While all the featured countries experience high out-of-school rates, some, such as Niger and Chad, exhibit particularly alarming figures. This suggests systemic barriers to educational access that require urgent and sustained interventions.\nCall for Action: High out-of-school rates underscore significant vulnerabilities in child development, social stability, and future economic prospects. The data serves as an important guide for governments, NGOs, and international organizations to prioritize funding, educational initiatives, and policy reforms to address the underlying issues preventing children from attending school.\n\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Load the file\ndf = pd.read_csv('/content/unicef_metadata.csv')\n\n# Clean if needed\nif 'Unnamed: 0' in df.columns:\n    df = df.rename(columns={'Unnamed: 0': 'country'})\n\n# Clean GDP values\ndef clean_gdp(value):\n    if isinstance(value, str):\n        value = value.replace('$', '').replace(',', '')\n        try:\n            return float(value)\n        except:\n            return None\n    return value\n\ndf['GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)'] = df['GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)'].apply(clean_gdp)\n\n# Ensure year is numeric\ndf['year'] = pd.to_numeric(df['year'], errors='coerce')\n\n# Get latest GDP per capita per country\nlatest = df.sort_values('year').drop_duplicates(subset='country', keep='last')\n\n# Countries you want\ncountries = [\n    'Marshall Islands', 'Senegal', 'Burkina Faso', 'Jordan', 'Tuvalu',\n    'Micronesia, Federated States of', 'Tanzania, United Republic of',\n    'Guinea', 'Zimbabwe', 'Ethiopia'\n]\n\nfiltered = latest[latest['country'].isin(countries)]\n\n# Now plot using Plotly\nfig = px.bar(\n    filtered,\n    x='country',\n    y='GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)',\n    text='GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)',\n    labels={'country': 'Country', 'GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)': 'GDP per Capita (2015 US$)'},\n    title='Average GDP per Capita (constant 2015 US$) of the Countries',\n    hover_data={'GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)': ':.2f'}\n)\n\nfig.update_traces(texttemplate='%{text:.2f}', textposition='outside')\nfig.update_layout(xaxis_tickangle=-45)\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                            \n\n\n\n\nThe two visualizations provide a comparative snapshot of countries facing severe challenges in both educational access and economic prosperity. The first graph identifies the nations with the highest out-of-school rates among primary school children in 2020, highlighting critical gaps in universal education. The second graph examines the corresponding GDP per capita of these countries, offering a deeper understanding of their economic landscape.\nThis dual perspective emphasizes how educational deprivation and limited economic resources often coexist, creating a cycle of hardship that is difficult to break. Many of the countries featured are low- and middle-income nations where structural barriers to both schooling and economic growth persist.\nBy bringing together educational and economic indicators, UNICEF and other stakeholders can better prioritize interventions. Targeted investments in education, supported by broader economic development initiatives, are essential to addressing the root causes of child deprivation and fostering long-term, sustainable progress.\n##Temporal Trends: Economic Growth and Drop-Out Rate Over Time‚åõÔ∏è:\nIn the following visualizations, we delve into the progression of two interconnected metrics over time.\n\nThe first graph charts the evolution of the average GDP per capita, serving as a broad indicator of economic growth and national prosperity across decades.\nThe second graph focuses on educational access, specifically illustrating the average primary school drop-out rate, highlighting trends in school attendance and, by extension, human capital development.\n\nTogether, these trends offer a comprehensive view of how economic growth and educational participation have evolved, and the relationship between them.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Load metadata file\nmetadata_df = pd.read_csv('/content/unicef_metadata.csv')\n\n# Clean GDP column\ndef clean_gdp(value):\n    if isinstance(value, str):\n        value = value.replace('$', '').replace(',', '')\n        try:\n            return float(value)\n        except:\n            return None\n    return value\n\nmetadata_df['GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)'] = metadata_df['GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)'].apply(clean_gdp)\nmetadata_df['year'] = pd.to_numeric(metadata_df['year'], errors='coerce')\n\n# Group by year and calculate average GDP per capita\ngdp_avg_all = metadata_df.groupby('year')['GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)'].mean().reset_index()\n\n# Plot: Average GDP per Capita over time (ALL countries) with red color\nfig = px.line(\n    gdp_avg_all,\n    x='year',\n    y='GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)',\n    labels={'GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)': 'Average GDP per Capita (2015 US$)'},\n    title='Evolution of Average GDP per Capita Over Time (All Countries)',\n    color_discrete_sequence=['red']  # &lt;&lt;&lt; setting color to red\n)\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                            \n\n\n\n\nThe first graph spans from 1960 onwards and captures the gradual increase in the average GDP per capita globally. Expressed in constant 2015 U.S. dollars to neutralize inflationary effects, the graph reflects a steady upward trajectory in global economic output per individual. This rising trend underscores the expansion of economies worldwide and suggests greater resource availability, potentially improving access to essential services like education, healthcare, and social welfare programs.\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Load indicator file\nindicator_df = pd.read_csv('/content/unicef_indicator.csv')\n\n# Filter to Out-of-School Rate (for Primary School Age, Total gender)\nout_of_school = indicator_df[\n    (indicator_df['indicator'].str.contains('Out-of-school rate', case=False)) &\n    (indicator_df['sex'] == 'Total')\n]\n\n# Group by year and calculate average percentage\ndropout_avg = out_of_school.groupby('year')['Percentage'].mean().reset_index()\n\n# Plot: Average Drop-out Rate over time\nfig = px.line(\n    dropout_avg,\n    x='year',\n    y='Percentage',\n    labels={'Percentage': 'Average Out-of-School Rate (%)'},\n    title='Evolution of Average Drop-out Rate Over Time (Primary School Age)',\n    color_discrete_sequence=['blue']  # You can change the color if you want!\n)\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                            \n\n\n\n\nThe second graph, covering a more recent timeframe, tracks the evolution of the average primary school drop-out rate across countries. In contrast to the consistent rise in GDP, this graph reveals a gradual decline in drop-out rates over the years. This suggests a growing global emphasis on educational access and retention, with more children staying in school compared to previous decades. Although fluctuations exist, the overall trend signals positive strides toward achieving universal primary education ‚Äî a key objective under UNICEF‚Äôs global mission.\nOver the selected periods, the average socio-economic landscape shows marked improvement, both in terms of economic opportunity and educational access.\nSummary: The trend analysis of average GDP per capita and average drop-out rates reveals an encouraging narrative. The consistent increase in GDP per capita suggests broad economic growth, while the decline in drop-out rates points to educational advancements. Together, these patterns highlight the critical link between economic prosperity and improvements in human development outcomes, reinforcing the importance of sustained investments in both economic and educational sectors to drive global progress.\n##Comparative Analysis of Drop-Out Rates by Gender ‚ö§:\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Load the indicator file\nindicator_df = pd.read_csv('/content/unicef_indicator.csv')\n\n# Filter for Out-of-School Rate (Primary School Age)\nout_of_school = indicator_df[\n    (indicator_df['indicator'].str.contains('Out-of-school rate', case=False))\n]\n\n# Calculate average drop-out rate by gender\ngender_avg = out_of_school.groupby('sex')['Percentage'].mean().reindex(['Female', 'Male', 'Total']).reset_index()\n\n# Map colors manually\ncolor_map = {'Female': 'pink', 'Male': 'skyblue', 'Total': 'grey'}\n\n# Plot using Plotly\nfig = px.bar(\n    gender_avg,\n    x='Percentage',\n    y='sex',\n    orientation='h',\n    color='sex',\n    color_discrete_map=color_map,\n    text=gender_avg['Percentage'].apply(lambda x: f'{x:.2f}%'),\n    labels={'Percentage': 'Average Drop-out Rate (%)', 'sex': 'Gender'},\n    title='Gender-based Observation of Drop-out Rates'\n)\n\nfig.update_traces(textposition='outside')\nfig.update_layout(showlegend=False)\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                            \n\n\n\n\nThe gender-based analysis of primary school drop-out rates highlights a relatively small gap between male and female children. While slight differences exist ‚Äî with females experiencing a marginally higher average drop-out rate ‚Äî the overall trends suggest that educational access challenges are broadly shared across genders.\nThis observation implies that interventions aimed at improving school retention should adopt an inclusive strategy rather than being exclusively gender-targeted. Addressing systemic barriers such as poverty, geographic isolation, and inadequate educational infrastructure will likely yield benefits for all children, regardless of gender. A comprehensive approach ensures that educational reforms and social programs are equitable, fostering an environment where every child has an equal opportunity to complete their primary education."

A visible inverse trend emerges ‚Äî countries with higher GDP per capita tend to exhibit lower primary school drop-out rates. This suggests that greater economic prosperity may be linked to better access to education and improved school retention rates.\nThe second scatter plot examines the correlation between life expectancy at birth and primary school drop-out rates. A similar inverse relationship is observed: countries with higher life expectancy typically show lower rates of primary school drop-out. This pattern underscores the broader link between health outcomes and educational access, where stronger healthcare systems and higher overall well-being contribute to improved educational participation.\nTogether, these analyses highlight important socio-economic dynamics influencing educational outcomes. They emphasize that efforts to reduce drop-out rates must address not just educational reforms but also broader investments in economic growth and healthcare. Understanding these interconnected factors is essential for designing comprehensive policies that promote both child well-being and national development.\nThese findings indicate that stronger economic conditions and better health outcomes are closely associated with lower primary school drop-out rates, emphasizing the multifaceted nature of child development challenges.\n##Global Out-of-School Rates Among Primary School Children Among Several Yearsüåç: Finally‚Ä¶\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv('/content/unicef_indicator.csv')\nprint(df['indicator'].unique())  # List all available indicators\nprint(df['time_period'].unique())  # List all years\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Load data\ndf = pd.read_csv('/content/unicef_indicator.csv')\n\n# Filter for indicator and total\nindicator_name = 'Out-of-school rate for children of primary school age (administrative data)'\ndf_filtered = df[\n    (df['indicator'] == indicator_name) & (df['sex'] == 'Total')\n]\n\n# Ensure year is integer and sorted\ndf_filtered['year'] = df_filtered['year'].astype(int)\ndf_filtered = df_filtered.sort_values('year')\n\n# Create animated choropleth\nfig = px.choropleth(\n    df_filtered,\n    locations='country',\n    locationmode='country names',\n    color='Percentage',\n    hover_name='country',\n    animation_frame='year',\n    color_continuous_scale=px.colors.diverging.RdBu[::-1],  # Reversed RdBu\n    range_color=(0, 60),\n    title='Global Out-of-School Rates Among Primary School Children (2014‚Äì2022)'\n)\n\nfig.update_layout(geo=dict(showframe=False, showcoastlines=True))\nfig.show()\n\n\nSettingWithCopyWarning:\n\n\nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.\nTry using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead\n\nSee the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                            \n\n\n\n\nThe map displays the global distribution of primary school-aged children who are out of school, based on administrative data.
